Minecraft-MemAllocate-
======================

MinecraftMemAllocate is a simple tool for launching Minecraft.exe with more allocated ram.
Increasing your RAM with minecraft avoids the java "Out of memory" error that can occure because Minecraft sets ~450mb as the default allocation.
You will also experience less lag and smoother gameplay.

Its really easy to use too:
* Save the MineMemAllocate.exe located in 'Downloads' to your desktop.
* Open the file
* Find your minecraft.exe file
* Set a minimum ammount of RAM for minecraft to use (More than 10mb)
* Set a maximum ammount of RAM for minecraft to use (Cannot exceed available RAM)
* Click 'Launch Minecraft'

If you find that nothing happens when you click 'Launch Minecraft', try lowering your maximum RAM.

* You need Java for this to work (obviously).

If you have any problems, open an issue or email me at Jonty800@gmail.com

* This has not been tested with Windows XP or Mono
